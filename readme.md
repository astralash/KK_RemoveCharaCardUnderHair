## RemoveCCUnderHair\RemoveUnderHairCharaCard.py
A simple script that remove al pubic hair of chara cards in current directory and its subdirectories.
I wrote 'HowToUse' in Chinese and I'm lazy to translate it, so key points are below:
remember to backup valuable cards such as original cards and paid cards
I use error processing machanism to judge whether the png file is a chara card.
It's my first time to use such strategy so I'm not sure if it's acceptable.
I have to do that cauz the lib does not provide a judging function.
